# Flappy Bird Game

A 2D side-scrolling game implementation of the classic Flappy Bird mobile game, developed using Unity. The player controls a bird that must navigate through an endless series of green pipes without colliding, featuring infinite pipe generation, parallax scrolling backgrounds, and responsive gameplay mechanics.

## Features
- Side-scrolling gameplay with infinite pipe generation
- Parallax background effects for depth
- Simple tap-to-flap controls
- Game over and restart functionality
- Built with Unity 2019.4 LTS

## Project Structure
- `Assets/`: Contains all game assets including sprites, scripts, and scenes
- `Assets/unity-flappy-bird-tutorial-main/`: Core game implementation
- `Scripts/`: C# scripts for game logic (Player, Pipes, Spawner, GameManager, Parallax)
- `Sprites/`: Game graphics and UI elements

This project serves as both a playable game and a learning resource for Unity 2D game development concepts.
