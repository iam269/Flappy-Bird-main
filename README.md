🐦 **Flappy Bird Game** 🐦

This project is a comprehensive 2D side-scrolling implementation of the iconic Flappy Bird mobile game, meticulously crafted using Unity game engine. 🎮 Players take control of a vibrant bird character, skillfully navigating through an endless barrage of green pipes, where precision timing and reflexes are paramount. The game features dynamic obstacle generation, immersive parallax scrolling backgrounds that create a sense of depth and motion, and intuitive touch-based controls that make gameplay accessible yet challenging. 🚀

Dive into a world of endless fun, where each flap propels the bird higher, and every pipe dodged brings a rush of adrenaline! 🐔💨 The core mechanics revolve around physics-based movement, collision detection, and score tracking, all wrapped in a retro pixel art aesthetic that harkens back to the golden age of mobile gaming.
